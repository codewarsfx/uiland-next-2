							be deemed as a serious breach of the Terms and we shall have the
							right to suspend or terminate your account upon confirmation.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h1>Payment Terms</h1>
						<p>
							When you purchase our Plan, you expressly authorise us or our
							third-party payment processor to charge you for such Plan. You
							represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all
							payment methods that you provide to us. In the event that you fail
							to pay the full amount owed to us, we may limit your access to the
							Services, in addition to any other rights or remedies we may have.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h1>Authorisation for Recurring Payments</h1>
						<p>
							All pricing plans involve recurring fees (each, along with any
							applicable taxes and other charges are a “Subscription Fee”).
							Depending on which options you choose, those fees may recur
							quarterly or yearly thereafter, at the then-current rate. Please
							note that our fees are subject to change, although we will notify
							you before we effect any change. By agreeing to these Terms and
							purchasing a Plan, you acknowledge that your Plan has recurring
							payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring
							payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Plan by you or
							UiLand. We (or our third-party payment processor) will
							automatically charge you in accordance with the term of your Plan
							(e.g., every quarter or year), on the calendar day corresponding
							to the commencement of your Plan using the payment information you
							have provided. In the event your Plan begins on a day not
							contained in a later month, your payment method will be charged on
							such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started
							a yearly Plan on January 31st 2022, your next payment date is
							likely to be January 31st 2023, and your payment method would be
							billed on that date. We may also periodically authorise your
							payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related
							charges. Your Plan continues until cancelled by you or we
							terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Plan in
							accordance with these Terms.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h1>Taxes</h1>
						<p>
							Subscription Fees do not include taxes, and you agree to pay all
							sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property, or
							other tax (including any interest and penalties) with respect to
							the transactions and payments under these Terms.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
						<p>
							Strictly no refunds will be offered unless required by the law or
							at UiLand’s sole discretion, if any.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
						<p>
							You may cancel your Plan any time but please note that such
							cancellation will only be effective at the end of the then-current
							Plan period. Unless required by law, you will not receive a refund
							of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current
							subscription period at the time of cancellation.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h1>Intellectual Policy</h1>
						<p>
							Given that the Company deals with complex software engineering and
							creations, we are very cautious with our intellectual property
							rights (“IPRs”). Please read the following carefully.
						</p>
